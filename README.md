# DeerVision
Automated computer-vision scripts for deer detection in thermal imagery. Created in partnership with Remote Intelligence, LLC for Juniata's Advanced Physical Lab (Spring 20).


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

A list of required libraries used by DeerVision can be found [here](https://github.com/michaellyoungg/DeerVision/blob/master/requirements.txt)
