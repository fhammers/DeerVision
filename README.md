# DeerVision
Automated computer-vision scripts for deer detection in thermal imagery. Created in partnership with Remote Intelligence, LLC for Juniata's Advanced Physical Lab (Spring 20).


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

One time release to Remote Intelligence clients.

## Built With

* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - Computer vision library
* [WebODM](https://www.opendronemap.org/webodm/) - Open source drone cloud service used for thermal image stitching
